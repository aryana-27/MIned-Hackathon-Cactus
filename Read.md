# Academic Research Paper Simplification

This project was developed for the **Mined Hackathon**, conducted by **Nirma University, Ahmedabad**, in collaboration with **Cactus**. The primary objective of this project is to enhance accessibility and comprehension of academic research papers by converting them into easy-to-understand multimedia formats. We achieve this through the automated generation of **videos, PowerPoint presentations (PPTs), and podcasts**, making complex research topics accessible to a wider audience.

## 📌 Project Overview

Academic research papers are often dense and difficult to comprehend due to complex language and technical jargon. This project addresses that challenge by simplifying academic content through engaging multimedia formats:

- **🎥 Video Summaries**: Visual explanations of key concepts and research findings.
- **📊 PowerPoint Presentations (PPTs)**: Summarized slides for quick learning and effective presentations.
- **🎙️ Podcasts**: Audio summaries that allow users to learn while commuting or multitasking.

These resources make it easier for **students, researchers, and academics** to grasp complex ideas in a digestible and engaging manner.
