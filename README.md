# Academic Research Paper Simplification

This project was developed for the Mined Hackathon, conducted by Nirma University, Ahmedabad, in collaboration with Cactus. The primary goal of the project is to make academic research papers more accessible and easier to understand. We achieve this by generating multimedia content such as videos, PowerPoint presentations, and podcasts that simplify complex research topics for a wider audience.

## Project Overview

Academic research papers can often be dense and difficult to comprehend. This project aims to break down the barriers of academic knowledge by creating engaging content in the form of:

- **Videos**: Visual explanations of key concepts and research findings.
- **PPTs**: Summarized slides for quick learning and presentations.
- **Podcasts**: Audio versions that allow users to learn while on the go.

These resources make it easier for students, researchers, and academics to grasp complex ideas in a more digestible format.

## Features

- **Automated Video Generation**: Converts research paper content into engaging videos, highlighting the key points and concepts.
- **Dynamic PowerPoint Creation**: Generates PPTs summarizing the research paper for easier presentation.
- **Podcast Generation**: Creates audio summaries that can be listened to anytime, anywhere.
- **Easy Access**: All generated content is accessible through a simple interface.
